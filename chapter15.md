# Chapter 15: Scalar Wave Optics Foundations

In this chapter, we transition from geometric optics and volume rendering to wave optics, establishing the mathematical foundation for understanding light as an electromagnetic wave. We'll derive the scalar wave approximation from Maxwell's equations and explore fundamental diffraction phenomena that become crucial when wavelength-scale effects matter. This bridge from ray-based to wave-based descriptions enriches our understanding of light transport and sets the stage for advanced optical phenomena in computer graphics.

## 15.1 From Maxwell's Equations to the Helmholtz Equation

### Vector Wave Equation

We begin with Maxwell's equations in a source-free, homogeneous medium:

∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t
∇ × **H** = ∂**D**/∂t
∇ · **D** = 0
∇ · **B** = 0

For linear, isotropic media: **D** = ε**E** and **B** = μ**H**, where ε = ε₀εᵣ and μ = μ₀μᵣ.

Taking the curl of the first equation and using the vector identity ∇ × (∇ × **E**) = ∇(∇ · **E**) - ∇²**E**:

∇²**E** - με(∂²**E**/∂t²) = 0

This is the vector wave equation with wave velocity v = 1/√(με) = c/n, where n = √(εᵣμᵣ) is the refractive index.

### Scalar Wave Approximation

For many optical phenomena, we can approximate the vector field with a scalar field U(r,t). This is valid when:
- The medium is homogeneous over wavelength scales
- Polarization effects are negligible
- The field varies slowly compared to wavelength

Assuming harmonic time dependence U(r,t) = u(r)e^(-iωt), we obtain:

∇²u + k²u = 0

where k = ω/v = 2πn/λ is the wavenumber. This is the **Helmholtz equation**.

### Physical Interpretation

The Helmholtz equation describes monochromatic wave propagation where:
- k² represents the spatial frequency content
- Solutions include plane waves: u = A e^(i**k**·**r**)
- And spherical waves: u = (A/r)e^(ikr)

### Connection to Volume Rendering

The Helmholtz equation relates to our unified volume rendering framework through:

L(x,ω) = ∫ σₛ(x')G(x,x')L(x',ω')dV'

where the Green's function G satisfies:
(∇² + k²)G(x,x') = -δ(x-x')

In the geometric optics limit (k→∞), this reduces to ray propagation. For finite k, we capture wave effects.

## 15.2 Huygens-Fresnel Principle

### Historical Development

Christiaan Huygens (1678) proposed that each point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1815) added the principle of interference, explaining diffraction patterns through the coherent superposition of these wavelets.

### Mathematical Formulation

Consider a wavefront Σ at time t. The field at point P at time t + Δt is:

u(P) = (1/iλ) ∫∫_Σ u(Q) (e^(ikr))/r K(χ) dS

where:
- Q is a point on the wavefront Σ
- r = |P - Q| is the distance
- K(χ) is the obliquity factor
- χ is the angle between normal and P-Q direction

### Obliquity Factor

Fresnel originally proposed K(χ) = (1 + cos χ)/2, which:
- Equals 1 for forward propagation (χ = 0)
- Equals 0 for backward propagation (χ = π)
- Provides smooth angular dependence

### Kirchhoff's Rigorous Formulation

Gustav Kirchhoff (1882) derived the Huygens-Fresnel principle from the Helmholtz equation using Green's theorem:

u(P) = (1/4π) ∫∫_Σ [e^(ikr)/r ∂u/∂n - u ∂/∂n(e^(ikr)/r)] dS

For an aperture in an opaque screen with incident field u_inc:
- On aperture: u = u_inc, ∂u/∂n = ∂u_inc/∂n
- On screen: u = 0, ∂u/∂n = 0

This yields the **Kirchhoff diffraction formula**:

u(P) = (1/iλ) ∫∫_aperture u_inc(Q) (e^(ikr))/r (1 + cos χ)/2 dS

### Connection to Rendering

The Huygens-Fresnel principle parallels importance sampling in rendering:
- Secondary sources ↔ Sample points
- Wavelet superposition ↔ Monte Carlo integration
- Obliquity factor ↔ Cosine weighting

## 15.3 Fresnel Diffraction Integral

### Near-Field Geometry

Consider a planar aperture in the z=0 plane illuminated by a field u₀(x₀,y₀). The field at observation point P(x,y,z) is given by the Kirchhoff integral. For near-field diffraction, we expand the distance r in the phase term.

Let **r** = (x,y,z) and **r₀** = (x₀,y₀,0), then:

r = |**r** - **r₀**| = √[(x-x₀)² + (y-y₀)² + z²]

### Fresnel Approximation

For z >> (x-x₀), (y-y₀), we expand r using the binomial theorem:

r ≈ z[1 + (x-x₀)²/2z² + (y-y₀)²/2z²]

Keeping terms up to quadratic order in the phase (but only zeroth order in amplitude):

e^(ikr)/r ≈ (e^(ikz)/z) exp[ik/2z((x-x₀)² + (y-y₀)²)]

### Fresnel Diffraction Formula

Substituting into the Kirchhoff integral:

u(x,y,z) = (e^(ikz)/iλz) ∫∫_aperture u₀(x₀,y₀) exp[ik/2z((x-x₀)² + (y-y₀)²)] dx₀dy₀

Expanding the quadratic term:

u(x,y,z) = (e^(ikz)/iλz) exp[ik/2z(x² + y²)] × 
           ∫∫ u₀(x₀,y₀) exp[ik/2z(x₀² + y₀²)] exp[-ik/z(xx₀ + yy₀)] dx₀dy₀

### Validity Conditions

The Fresnel approximation is valid when:

z³ >> (π/4λ)[(x-x₀)² + (y-y₀)²]²_max

This ensures the quartic phase error is less than π/2. Define the Fresnel number:

F = a²/λz

where a is the aperture dimension. The approximation holds for F ≳ 1.

### Computational Methods

1. **Direct Integration**: Numerical quadrature of the Fresnel integral
2. **FFT Method**: Using the convolution property with chirp functions
3. **Angular Spectrum**: Propagation in Fourier domain (most efficient)

The angular spectrum method expresses:

u(x,y,z) = ℱ⁻¹{ℱ{u₀(x₀,y₀)} × exp[ikz√(1-(λfₓ)²-(λfᵧ)²)]}

where fₓ, fᵧ are spatial frequencies.

## 15.4 Fraunhofer Diffraction and Fourier Optics

### Far-Field Approximation

In the Fraunhofer (far-field) regime, we further approximate the Fresnel integral by assuming the observation distance z is so large that:

z >> k(x₀² + y₀²)_max/2

This allows us to move the quadratic phase term outside the integral:

u(x,y,z) = (e^(ikz)/iλz) exp[ik/2z(x² + y²)] × 
           ∫∫ u₀(x₀,y₀) exp[-ik/z(xx₀ + yy₀)] dx₀dy₀

### Fourier Transform Relationship

The integral is now a 2D Fourier transform of the aperture field:

u(x,y,z) = (e^(ikz)/iλz) exp[ik/2z(x² + y²)] × ℱ{u₀(x₀,y₀)}|_{fₓ=x/λz, fᵧ=y/λz}

For a plane wave incident on the aperture (u₀ = A(x₀,y₀) where A is the aperture function):

u(x,y,z) ∝ ℱ{A(x₀,y₀)}

**Key insight**: The far-field diffraction pattern is the Fourier transform of the aperture.

### Examples

1. **Rectangular aperture** A(x₀,y₀) = rect(x₀/a)rect(y₀/b):
   u(x,y) ∝ sinc(ax/λz)sinc(by/λz)

2. **Circular aperture** of radius a:
   u(r,θ) ∝ 2J₁(kar/z)/(kar/z)
   where J₁ is the Bessel function of the first kind.

3. **Double slit** with separation d:
   u(x) ∝ sinc(ax/λz)cos(πdx/λz)

### Angular Spectrum Representation

Any field can be decomposed into plane waves:

u(x,y,z) = ∫∫ A(kₓ,kᵧ) exp[i(kₓx + kᵧy + kᵣz)] dkₓdkᵧ

where kᵣ = √(k² - kₓ² - kᵧ²) for propagating waves (kₓ² + kᵧ² < k²).

The angular spectrum A(kₓ,kᵧ) = ℱ{u(x,y,0)} represents the field as a superposition of plane waves traveling in different directions.

### Connection to Rendering

The Fourier optics framework relates to rendering through:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: BRDF ↔ Angular spectrum
2. **Sampling Theory**: Nyquist criterion for alias-free rendering
3. **Filtering**: Anti-aliasing ↔ Low-pass filtering in Fourier domain
4. **Light Field**: 4D Fourier analysis of radiance

The rendering equation in Fourier space:

L̃(ω) = ρ̃(ω) ⊗ L̃ᵢ(ω)

where ⊗ denotes convolution, showing how material properties filter incident illumination.

## 15.5 Diffraction-Limited Imaging Systems

### Point Spread Function (PSF)

An ideal imaging system maps each object point to a unique image point. However, diffraction limits this ideal behavior. The image of a point source is the **Point Spread Function (PSF)**.

For a circular aperture of diameter D and focal length f, the PSF in the image plane is:

h(r) = |ℱ{P(x,y)}|² = [2J₁(πDr/λf)/(πDr/λf)]²

where P(x,y) is the pupil function (1 inside aperture, 0 outside).

### Airy Disk and Resolution

The PSF for a circular aperture forms the **Airy pattern**:
- Central bright disk (Airy disk) containing 84% of energy
- Surrounded by concentric rings of decreasing intensity

The radius of the first zero (Airy disk radius):

r₀ = 1.22λf/D = 1.22λF#

where F# = f/D is the f-number.

### Rayleigh Criterion

Two point sources are "just resolved" when the maximum of one Airy disk falls on the first minimum of the other:

θ_min = 1.22λ/D

This angular resolution limit is fundamental to all imaging systems.

### Coherent vs Incoherent Imaging

**Incoherent imaging** (typical for natural light):
- Intensities add: I_total = I₁ + I₂
- Image intensity = |Object|² ⊗ |PSF|²
- Linear in intensity

**Coherent imaging** (laser illumination):
- Fields add: U_total = U₁ + U₂
- Image field = Object ⊗ PSF
- Linear in complex amplitude
- Can exhibit interference effects

### Transfer Functions

**Optical Transfer Function (OTF)** for incoherent imaging:
OTF(f) = ℱ{|PSF|²}

**Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)**:
MTF(f) = |OTF(f)|

For a circular aperture:
MTF(ν) = (2/π)[arccos(ν) - ν√(1-ν²)] for ν ≤ 1
MTF(ν) = 0 for ν > 1

where ν = λf·f_spatial/D is the normalized spatial frequency.

### Implications for Computer Graphics

1. **Depth of Field**: Diffraction sets the fundamental limit on DOF
   - Circle of confusion cannot be smaller than Airy disk
   - Hyperfocal distance affected by diffraction

2. **Bokeh Rendering**: Physical bokeh shapes from PSF
   - Aperture shape determines PSF pattern
   - Diffraction softens geometric bokeh

3. **Glints and Highlights**: Wave optics predicts sparkle patterns
   - Interference creates structured highlights
   - Important for realistic material appearance

4. **Camera Models**: Beyond pinhole approximation
   - Finite aperture effects
   - Wavelength-dependent resolution

## Exercises

### Basic Understanding (3 problems)

**Exercise 15.1**: Helmholtz Equation Solutions
Show that u(r) = (A/r)exp(ikr) is a solution to the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates. What physical wave does this represent?

*Hint*: Use the spherical Laplacian: ∇²u = (1/r²)d/dr(r²du/dr) for spherically symmetric functions.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For u(r) = (A/r)exp(ikr):

du/dr = A[(-1/r²)exp(ikr) + (ik/r)exp(ikr)] = (A/r)exp(ikr)[ik - 1/r]

r²du/dr = A·r·exp(ikr)[ik - 1/r] = A·exp(ikr)[ikr - 1]

d/dr(r²du/dr) = A[ik·exp(ikr)·[ikr - 1] + exp(ikr)·ik]
                = A·exp(ikr)[−k²r + 2ik]

∇²u = (A/r²)exp(ikr)[−k²r + 2ik] = (A/r)exp(ikr)[−k²]

Therefore: ∇²u + k²u = (A/r)exp(ikr)[−k² + k²] = 0 ✓

This represents an outgoing spherical wave from a point source.

**Exercise 15.2**: Fresnel Number
A plane wave (λ = 500nm) illuminates a circular aperture of radius a = 1mm. At what distance z does the Fresnel number F = a²/λz equal 1? What approximation regime is this?

*Hint*: The Fresnel approximation is valid for F ≳ 1, while Fraunhofer requires F << 1.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Given: λ = 500 × 10⁻⁹ m, a = 1 × 10⁻³ m

F = a²/λz = 1

Solving for z:
z = a²/λ = (10⁻³)² / (500 × 10⁻⁹) = 10⁻⁶ / (5 × 10⁻⁷) = 2 m

At z = 2m, we're at the transition between Fresnel (near-field) and Fraunhofer (far-field) regimes. For z < 2m, use Fresnel diffraction; for z >> 2m, Fraunhofer approximation is valid.
</details>

**Exercise 15.3**: Airy Disk Size
A camera lens has focal length f = 50mm and aperture diameter D = 25mm (f/2). Calculate the Airy disk radius for green light (λ = 550nm). How does this compare to typical pixel sizes?

*Hint*: The Airy disk radius is r₀ = 1.22λf/D.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Given: f = 50mm, D = 25mm, λ = 550nm = 550 × 10⁻⁹ m

r₀ = 1.22λf/D = 1.22 × (550 × 10⁻⁹) × (50 × 10⁻³) / (25 × 10⁻³)
   = 1.22 × 550 × 10⁻⁹ × 2
   = 1.342 × 10⁻⁶ m = 1.34 μm

Diameter = 2r₀ = 2.68 μm

Modern camera sensors have pixel sizes of 1-5 μm, so the Airy disk spans approximately 1-3 pixels. This shows that many cameras are near the diffraction limit, especially at small apertures.
</details>

### Advanced Problems (3 problems)

**Exercise 15.4**: Fourier Optics and Rendering
Show that the rendering equation in the Fourier domain becomes a convolution. Start with:
L₀(x,ω₀) = ∫ ρ(x,ω₀,ωᵢ)L(x,ωᵢ)(ω₀·n)dωᵢ

*Hint*: Take the 2D spatial Fourier transform and use the convolution theorem.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Taking the 2D Fourier transform over x:

ℱ{L₀(x,ω₀)} = ℱ{∫ ρ(x,ω₀,ωᵢ)L(x,ωᵢ)(ω₀·n)dωᵢ}

For spatially-invariant BRDF ρ(x,ω₀,ωᵢ) = ρ(ω₀,ωᵢ):

L̃₀(k,ω₀) = ∫ ρ(ω₀,ωᵢ)ℱ{L(x,ωᵢ)}(ω₀·n)dωᵢ
          = ∫ ρ(ω₀,ωᵢ)L̃(k,ωᵢ)(ω₀·n)dωᵢ

For textured surfaces where ρ varies with x:

L̃₀(k,ω₀) = ∫ [ρ̃(k,ω₀,ωᵢ) ⊗ L̃(k,ωᵢ)](ω₀·n)dωᵢ

This shows that spatial texture variations cause frequency-domain convolution, leading to blur and aliasing if not properly sampled.
</details>

**Exercise 15.5**: Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions
Derive the Kirchhoff diffraction formula from the Helmholtz equation using Green's theorem. Show why the boundary conditions on an opaque screen are problematic.

*Hint*: Use Green's function G = exp(ikr)/r and Green's theorem: ∫∫∫_V (ψ∇²φ - φ∇²ψ)dV = ∫∫_S (ψ∂φ/∂n - φ∂ψ/∂n)dS

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Let u satisfy (∇² + k²)u = 0 and G = exp(ikr)/r satisfy (∇² + k²)G = -4πδ(r).

Applying Green's theorem with ψ = G and φ = u:

∫∫∫_V [G∇²u - u∇²G]dV = ∫∫_S [G∂u/∂n - u∂G/∂n]dS

Since ∇²u = -k²u and ∇²G = -k²G - 4πδ(r-r₀):

-4πu(r₀) = ∫∫_S [G∂u/∂n - u∂G/∂n]dS

u(P) = (1/4π) ∫∫_S [exp(ikr)/r ∂u/∂n - u ∂/∂n(exp(ikr)/r)]dS

Kirchhoff boundary conditions assume:
- On aperture: u = u_incident, ∂u/∂n = ∂u_incident/∂n
- On screen: u = 0, ∂u/∂n = 0

The problem: These conditions are inconsistent at the aperture edge where u must jump from u_incident to 0 discontinuously, violating the wave equation. This is the "Kirchhoff paradox" - the approximation works well in practice despite theoretical inconsistency.
</details>

**Exercise 15.6**: Volume Rendering Connection
Show how the volume rendering equation with scattering reduces to the Huygens-Fresnel principle in the appropriate limit. Consider:
L(x,ω) = ∫ σₛ(x')p(x',ω'→ω)G(x,x')L(x',ω')dx'

*Hint*: Consider a thin scattering layer and the Green's function for the Helmholtz equation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For monochromatic light, the Green's function satisfies:
(∇² + k²)G(x,x') = -δ(x-x')

In free space: G(x,x') = exp(ik|x-x'|)/(4π|x-x'|)

For a thin scattering layer at z = 0 with σₛ(x') = σ₀δ(z')A(x',y'):

L(x,y,z) = ∫∫ σ₀A(x',y')p(θ)G(x,x')L₀(x',y')dx'dy'

For forward scattering p(θ) ≈ (1 + cos θ)/2 and incident field L₀:

L(x,y,z) = σ₀/(4π) ∫∫ A(x',y')L₀(x',y') × 
           [exp(ikr)/r][(1 + cos χ)/2]dx'dy'

Setting σ₀/(4π) = 1/(iλ) recovers the Huygens-Fresnel formula:

u(P) = (1/iλ) ∫∫ u₀(Q)[exp(ikr)/r]K(χ)dS

This shows that the Huygens-Fresnel principle emerges from volume scattering in the limit of a thin layer with appropriate scattering properties.

### Challenge Problems (2 problems)

**Exercise 15.7**: Computational Complexity
Compare the computational complexity of three methods for computing Fresnel diffraction patterns:
1. Direct numerical integration
2. FFT-based convolution  
3. Angular spectrum method

For an N×N sampling grid, derive the complexity and discuss trade-offs.

*Hint*: Consider both computational cost and memory requirements.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. **Direct Integration**: 
   - For each output point (N² total), integrate over N² input points
   - Complexity: O(N⁴)
   - Memory: O(N²)
   - Accurate but prohibitively slow for large N

2. **FFT Convolution**:
   - Fresnel integral as convolution with chirp function
   - Steps: FFT input (O(N²log N)), multiply (O(N²)), inverse FFT (O(N²log N))
   - Complexity: O(N²log N)
   - Memory: O(N²)
   - Requires careful sampling to avoid aliasing

3. **Angular Spectrum**:
   - Propagate in Fourier domain: H(fx,fy) = exp[ikz√(1-(λfx)²-(λfy)²)]
   - Steps: FFT (O(N²log N)), multiply by H (O(N²)), inverse FFT (O(N²log N))
   - Complexity: O(N²log N)
   - Memory: O(N²)
   - Most efficient, handles evanescent waves correctly

Trade-offs:
- Direct: Most flexible (arbitrary geometries) but slowest
- FFT convolution: Fast but can have aliasing issues with quadratic phase
- Angular spectrum: Fastest and most accurate for planar geometries

For typical N = 1024: Direct takes ~10¹² operations vs ~10⁷ for FFT methods.
</details>

**Exercise 15.8**: Unified Framework
Develop a unified mathematical framework that encompasses both geometric ray tracing and wave optics. Show how to transition smoothly between regimes based on the Fresnel number.

*Hint*: Consider the stationary phase approximation and the relationship between rays and wavefronts.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Unified Framework**: Wigner Distribution Function (WDF)

The WDF W(x,k) combines position and momentum (direction) information:

W(x,k,z) = ∫ u*(x - ξ/2,z)u(x + ξ/2,z)exp(-ik·ξ)dξ

Properties:
- Marginals give intensity and angular spectrum: ∫W dk = |u(x)|², ∫W dx = |ũ(k)|²
- Evolution: ∂W/∂z + (k/k₀)·∇W = 0 (free space)
- Reduces to ray density in geometric limit

**Regime Transition**:

Define normalized scale parameter: ε = λz/a² = 1/F

1. **Geometric Optics** (ε → 0, F → ∞):
   - WDF → ray phase space density
   - W(x,k) = ∑ᵢ δ(x - xᵢ(z))δ(k - kᵢ)
   - Ray tracing valid

2. **Fresnel Regime** (ε ~ 1, F ~ 1):
   - Quadratic phase approximation
   - W spreads in phase space
   - Use Fresnel integrals

3. **Fraunhofer Regime** (ε >> 1, F << 1):
   - Position-momentum uncertainty maximized
   - W(x,k) ≈ W₀(x)W̃₀(k)
   - Fourier optics applies

**Smooth Transition**:

Propagation operator: P(z) = exp[iz(k²/2k₀ + Φ(x,k,ε))]

where Φ interpolates:
- Φ → 0 as ε → 0 (geometric)
- Φ → higher-order terms as ε increases

This framework unifies:
- Ray tracing (ε → 0)
- Gaussian beam propagation (intermediate ε)
- Full wave optics (arbitrary ε)

The WDF provides a phase-space representation that smoothly transitions between particle-like rays and wave-like diffraction, controlled by the Fresnel number.

## Common Pitfalls and Errors

### Approximation Validity
1. **Scalar Approximation**: Invalid for:
   - Strong focusing (NA > 0.6)
   - Near-field of subwavelength features
   - Polarization-dependent effects

2. **Fresnel vs Fraunhofer**: 
   - Fresnel: F ≳ 1 (near-field)
   - Fraunhofer: F << 1 (far-field)
   - Transition region needs careful handling

3. **Paraxial Approximation**: Breaks down for:
   - Large angles (> 15-20°)
   - Wide-aperture systems
   - Off-axis points

### Numerical Considerations

1. **Sampling Requirements**:
   - Quadratic phase in Fresnel integral requires dense sampling
   - Nyquist criterion: Δx < λz/(2X) where X is field extent
   - Aliasing causes artificial fringes

2. **FFT Artifacts**:
   - Periodic boundary conditions create wraparound
   - Zero-padding needed for accurate convolution
   - Windowing functions reduce edge effects

3. **Phase Unwrapping**:
   - Computed phase limited to [-π, π]
   - Unwrapping algorithms needed for continuous phase
   - Sensitive to noise and undersampling

4. **Numerical Precision**:
   - Large k values cause precision loss
   - exp(ikr) oscillates rapidly for large r
   - Use differential propagation for long distances
