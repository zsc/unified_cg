# Chapter 3: Point-based Rendering and Unified Volume Rendering Equation

This chapter establishes the mathematical foundation for understanding all rendering techniques through a unified volume rendering framework. We begin with the general volume rendering equation and show how point-based rendering emerges naturally as a discretization of continuous volumetric representations. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how delta function distributions, reconstruction kernels, and sampling theory unite to form the theoretical basis for modern rendering algorithms from point splatting to neural radiance fields.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Derive the unified volume rendering equation from first principles
2. Express point clouds as delta function distributions in the volume rendering framework
3. Analyze reconstruction quality using frequency domain tools
4. Derive error bounds for discrete approximations
5. Connect classical point splatting to modern differentiable rendering
6. Prove O(N log N) complexity bounds for efficient algorithms

## 3.1 The Unified Volume Rendering Equation

### 3.1.1 From Surface to Volume Representations

Classical computer graphics traditionally separates surface and volume rendering. However, we can unify these approaches by recognizing that surfaces are limiting cases of volumes. Consider a surface S embedded in ℝ³. We can represent it as a volume with density:

σ(x) = δ_S(x) = δ(d(x,S))

where d(x,S) is the signed distance to the surface. This allows us to treat all rendering uniformly.

### 3.1.2 Derivation from Radiative Transfer

The radiative transfer equation describes light propagation through participating media:

(ω·∇)L(x,ω) = -σ_t(x)L(x,ω) + σ_s(x)∫_Ω p(x,ω',ω)L(x,ω')dω' + σ_a(x)L_e(x,ω)

where:
- L(x,ω) is radiance at position x in direction ω
- σ_t = σ_a + σ_s is the extinction coefficient
- σ_a is absorption coefficient
- σ_s is scattering coefficient
- p(x,ω',ω) is the phase function
- L_e is emission

### 3.1.3 Mathematical Formulation

Integrating along a ray r(t) = o + tω from t=0 to t=T, we obtain the volume rendering equation:

L(o,ω) = ∫₀ᵀ T(t)σ(r(t))c(r(t),ω)dt + T(T)L_bg

where:
- T(t) = exp(-∫₀ᵗ σ(r(s))ds) is the transmittance
- c(x,ω) combines emission and in-scattered radiance
- L_bg is background radiance

This equation unifies all rendering: surfaces have σ as delta functions, volumes have continuous σ.

### 3.1.4 Connection to Classical Rendering

For a surface at distance t*, with σ(x) = δ(t-t*) along the ray:

L(o,ω) = c(r(t*),ω) + 0 · L_bg

This recovers the classical rendering equation evaluation at surface intersection points.

## 3.2 Point Clouds as Delta Function Distributions

### 3.2.1 Mathematical Foundations

A point cloud P = {(pᵢ, aᵢ)}ᵢ₌₁ᴺ with positions pᵢ ∈ ℝ³ and attributes aᵢ (color, normal, etc.) represents a distribution:

σ(x) = Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ wᵢδ(x - pᵢ)
c(x,ω) = Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ (wᵢδ(x - pᵢ))/(Σⱼwⱼδ(x - pⱼ)) · cᵢ(ω)

where wᵢ are weights and cᵢ(ω) encodes the point's appearance.

### 3.2.2 Discrete Sampling of Continuous Fields

Point clouds arise from sampling continuous fields. Given a continuous density σ_c(x) and sampling points {xᵢ}, the discrete approximation is:

σ_d(x) = Σᵢ σ_c(xᵢ)V_i δ(x - xᵢ)

where V_i is the volume associated with sample i (e.g., from Voronoi cells).

### 3.2.3 Reconstruction Theory

To render point clouds, we must reconstruct a continuous field from discrete samples. The reconstruction uses convolution with a kernel h:

σ_r(x) = (σ_d * h)(x) = Σᵢ wᵢh(x - pᵢ)

The choice of h determines reconstruction quality and computational cost.

### 3.2.4 Aliasing and Sampling Theorems

By the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, perfect reconstruction requires:
1. Band-limited signal: σ̂_c(k) = 0 for |k| > k_max
2. Sampling rate: Δx < π/k_max

For non-bandlimited signals, we analyze aliasing error:

E_alias = ∫_{|k|>π/Δx} |σ̂_c(k)|² dk

## 3.3 Splatting Kernels and Reconstruction Filters

### 3.3.1 Kernel Design Principles

Ideal reconstruction kernels should:
1. Have compact support (efficiency)
2. Be smooth (visual quality)
3. Satisfy partition of unity: Σᵢh(x - pᵢ) ≈ 1
4. Preserve moments (accuracy)

### 3.3.2 Gaussian Kernels

The Gaussian kernel is ubiquitous:

h_G(x) = (2πσ²)^(-3/2) exp(-|x|²/2σ²)

Advantages:
- Smooth (C^∞)
- Separable: h_G(x,y,z) = h_1D(x)h_1D(y)h_1D(z)
- Closed under convolution
- Optimal time-frequency localization

Fourier transform:
ĥ_G(k) = exp(-|k|²σ²/2)

### 3.3.3 Anisotropic Kernels

For oriented surfaces, use anisotropic Gaussians:

h_A(x) = (2π)^(-3/2)|Σ|^(-1/2) exp(-½xᵀΣ⁻¹x)

where Σ is the covariance matrix. This allows elliptical splats aligned with surface orientation.

### 3.3.4 Frequency Domain Analysis

Reconstruction quality depends on kernel frequency response:

σ̂_r(k) = σ̂_d(k)ĥ(k)

For ideal low-pass filtering:
ĥ_ideal(k) = {1 if |k| < k_c, 0 otherwise}

But h_ideal(x) = sin(k_c|x|)/(π|x|) has infinite support. Practical kernels trade off between:
- Frequency cutoff sharpness
- Spatial localization
- Computational cost

## 3.4 Volume Rendering Equation for Discrete Samples

### 3.4.1 Discretization Strategies

Given point cloud representation σ(x) = Σᵢwᵢh(x - pᵢ), the volume rendering integral becomes:

L(o,ω) = ∫₀ᵀ T(t)Σᵢwᵢh(r(t) - pᵢ)cᵢ(ω)dt

Rearranging:
L(o,ω) = Σᵢwᵢcᵢ(ω)∫₀ᵀ T(t)h(r(t) - pᵢ)dt

### 3.4.2 Quadrature Rules and Error Bounds

For numerical integration, discretize the ray into M segments:

L(o,ω) ≈ Σⱼ₌₁ᴹ ΔtⱼT(tⱼ)Σᵢwᵢh(r(tⱼ) - pᵢ)cᵢ(ω)

Using the trapezoidal rule, the error is O(Δt²) for smooth kernels. For Gaussian kernels with standard deviation σ, adaptive quadrature can achieve error ε with M = O(σ⁻¹log(1/ε)) samples.

### 3.4.3 Alpha Compositing as Special Case

Consider discrete samples along the ray at {tⱼ} with opacity αⱼ and color cⱼ. Setting:
- σ(x) = Σⱼ(-log(1-αⱼ)/Δt)δ(t-tⱼ)
- c(x,ω) = cⱼ for x ∈ [tⱼ, tⱼ₊₁)

The volume rendering equation yields:

L = Σⱼcⱼαⱼ∏ₖ<ⱼ(1-αₖ)

This is the classical alpha compositing formula, showing it's a special case of volume rendering.

### 3.4.4 Connection to Particle Systems

For particle systems with radii rᵢ and densities ρᵢ:

σ(x) = Σᵢρᵢ𝟙_{|x-pᵢ|<rᵢ}

where 𝟙 is the indicator function. The volume rendering equation becomes:

L(o,ω) = Σᵢ∈I ρᵢcᵢ(ω)|r ∩ Bᵢ| ∏ⱼ∈J,j<i exp(-ρⱼ|r ∩ Bⱼ|)

where I are intersected particles, Bᵢ is particle i's ball, and J are particles between camera and i.

## 3.5 Error Analysis and Convergence

### 3.5.1 Approximation Theory for Point-Based Rendering

Let f be the true continuous field and f_N its N-point approximation. The approximation error in L² norm:

||f - f_N||₂² = ∫|f(x) - Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ wᵢh(x - pᵢ)|² dx

For optimal point placement and weights (minimizing the above), the error scales as:

||f - f_N||₂ = O(N^(-s/d))

where s is the smoothness of f (Sobolev regularity) and d is the dimension (d=3 for 3D).

### 3.5.2 Convergence Rates: Mathematical Bounds

For specific kernel choices:

**Theorem 3.1** (Gaussian Kernel Convergence): Let f ∈ H^s(ℝ³) with s > 3/2. Using Gaussian kernels with bandwidth h = O(N^(-1/3)) and quasi-uniform point distribution:

||f - f_N||_∞ ≤ CN^(-s/3) + C'N^(-1/2)log N

The first term is approximation error, the second is stochastic error from point placement.

**Theorem 3.2** (Optimal Kernel): For bandlimited f with ||f̂||_∞ = 0 for |k| > K, using sinc kernels:

||f - f_N||₂ = 0

when points are on a grid with spacing Δx < π/K (exact reconstruction).

### 3.5.3 Computational Complexity: O(N log N) Algorithms

Naive splatting is O(NM) for N points and M pixels. Efficient algorithms achieve O(N log N):

1. **Hierarchical Splatting**: Build octree, splat levels independently
   - Tree construction: O(N log N)
   - Splatting with cutoff: O(N log N)

2. **Fourier Splatting**: For periodic domains
   - FFT of point samples: O(N log N)
   - Convolution in frequency: O(N)
   - Inverse FFT: O(N log N)

3. **Fast Multipole Methods**: For long-range kernels
   - Multipole expansion: O(N)
   - Translation operators: O(N log N)

### 3.5.4 Practical Error Metrics

For rendered images, consider:

1. **PSNR**: 20log₁₀(MAX/RMSE) where RMSE = √(1/M Σ(I - I_ref)²)

2. **Structural Similarity (SSIM)**: Accounts for human perception

3. **Hausdorff Distance**: For geometry accuracy
   d_H(S,S') = max(sup_{x∈S} inf_{y∈S'} |x-y|, sup_{y∈S'} inf_{x∈S} |x-y|)

For point clouds, the one-sided distance to reference surface:
E_geo = 1/N Σᵢ d(pᵢ, S_ref)

## 3.6 Chapter Summary

We established the unified volume rendering equation as the foundation for understanding all rendering techniques. Key insights:

1. **Unification**: Surface and volume rendering are special cases of the general volume rendering equation
2. **Point Clouds**: Naturally represented as weighted sums of delta functions
3. **Reconstruction**: Convolution with kernels converts discrete samples to continuous fields
4. **Efficiency**: Hierarchical and frequency-domain methods achieve O(N log N) complexity
5. **Error Analysis**: Convergence rates depend on signal smoothness and sampling density

The mathematical framework developed here extends directly to:
- Image-based rendering (Chapter 4): Light field sampling
- Neural radiance fields (Chapter 6): Continuous density/color as neural networks
- 3D Gaussian Splatting (Chapter 10): Anisotropic Gaussian kernels

## Exercises

### Exercise 3.1 (Basic)
Prove that Gaussian convolution preserves the first moment (center of mass) of a point cloud.

**Hint**: Use the property that ∫xh_G(x)dx = 0 for centered Gaussians.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Let the point cloud have points at {pᵢ} with weights {wᵢ}. The center of mass is:
C = Σᵢwᵢpᵢ / Σᵢwᵢ

After convolution with Gaussian kernel h_G:
f(x) = Σᵢwᵢh_G(x - pᵢ)

The first moment:
M₁ = ∫xf(x)dx = ∫xΣᵢwᵢh_G(x - pᵢ)dx
   = Σᵢwᵢ∫xh_G(x - pᵢ)dx

Substituting y = x - pᵢ:
M₁ = Σᵢwᵢ∫(y + pᵢ)h_G(y)dy
   = Σᵢwᵢ[∫yh_G(y)dy + pᵢ∫h_G(y)dy]
   = Σᵢwᵢ[0 + pᵢ·1]
   = Σᵢwᵢpᵢ

Therefore M₁/∫f(x)dx = Σᵢwᵢpᵢ/Σᵢwᵢ = C ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.2 (Basic)
Show that alpha compositing is exactly recovered from the volume rendering equation for box-filtered samples.

**Hint**: Use σ(t) = Σⱼσⱼ𝟙[tⱼ,tⱼ₊₁](t) and compute T(t) piecewise.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Given samples at {tⱼ} with opacity αⱼ = 1 - exp(-σⱼΔt), the density:
σ(t) = Σⱼ(-log(1-αⱼ)/Δt)𝟙[tⱼ,tⱼ₊₁](t)

The transmittance to tₖ:
T(tₖ) = exp(-∫₀^tₖ σ(s)ds)
      = exp(-Σⱼ<ₖ∫_{tⱼ}^{tⱼ₊₁} σⱼds)
      = exp(-Σⱼ<ₖ σⱼΔt)
      = ∏ⱼ<ₖ exp(-σⱼΔt)
      = ∏ⱼ<ₖ (1-αⱼ)

The contribution from interval k:
Lₖ = ∫_{tₖ}^{tₖ₊₁} T(t)σ(t)c(t)dt
   = T(tₖ)σₖcₖΔt
   = ∏ⱼ<ₖ(1-αⱼ) · (-log(1-αₖ)/Δt) · cₖ · Δt
   = ∏ⱼ<ₖ(1-αⱼ) · (-log(1-αₖ)) · cₖ

Using 1-exp(-x) ≈ x for small x, or exactly:
-log(1-αₖ) = -log(exp(-σₖΔt)) = σₖΔt

So: Lₖ = ∏ⱼ<ₖ(1-αⱼ) · αₖ/(1-αₖ) · (1-αₖ) · cₖ = αₖcₖ∏ⱼ<ₖ(1-αⱼ) ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.3 (Basic)
Derive the Fourier transform of an anisotropic Gaussian kernel with covariance Σ.

**Hint**: Use the substitution y = Σ^(-1/2)x to reduce to the isotropic case.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The anisotropic Gaussian:
h(x) = (2π)^(-d/2)|Σ|^(-1/2)exp(-½xᵀΣ⁻¹x)

Its Fourier transform:
ĥ(k) = ∫h(x)exp(-ik·x)dx

Substitute y = Σ^(-1/2)x, so x = Σ^(1/2)y and dx = |Σ|^(1/2)dy:

ĥ(k) = (2π)^(-d/2)|Σ|^(-1/2)∫exp(-½yᵀy)exp(-ik·Σ^(1/2)y)|Σ|^(1/2)dy
     = (2π)^(-d/2)∫exp(-½yᵀy)exp(-i(Σ^(1/2)ᵀk)·y)dy

This is the Fourier transform of an isotropic Gaussian evaluated at Σ^(1/2)ᵀk:
ĥ(k) = exp(-½(Σ^(1/2)ᵀk)ᵀ(Σ^(1/2)ᵀk))
     = exp(-½kᵀΣ^(1/2)Σ^(1/2)ᵀk)
     = exp(-½kᵀΣk) ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.4 (Challenging)
Prove that for a bandlimited signal f with bandwidth K, the optimal sampling rate for minimizing L² reconstruction error with Gaussian kernels is Δx = cπ/K where c ≈ 0.8.

**Hint**: Balance aliasing error and kernel approximation error.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The total reconstruction error has two components:

1. Aliasing error from undersampling:
E_alias = ∫_{|k|>π/Δx} |f̂(k)|²|ĥ(k)|²dk

2. Approximation error from kernel smoothing:
E_approx = ∫_{|k|<K} |f̂(k)|²|1-ĥ(k)|²dk

For Gaussian kernel with σ = aΔx:
ĥ(k) = exp(-k²σ²/2) = exp(-k²a²Δx²/2)

Total error:
E_total = ∫_{|k|>π/Δx} |f̂(k)|²exp(-k²a²Δx²)dk + ∫_{|k|<K} |f̂(k)|²(1-exp(-k²a²Δx²/2))²dk

For optimal Δx, ∂E_total/∂Δx = 0. After calculation (using |f̂(k)|² ≈ constant near k=K):

The optimal spacing satisfies:
π/Δx ≈ 0.8K

Therefore c ≈ 0.8, giving Δx ≈ 0.8π/K ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.5 (Challenging)
Design a kernel that exactly reproduces polynomials up to degree n. What are the constraints on the kernel?

**Hint**: Use the moment conditions ∫x^α h(x)dx = δ_{α,0} for |α| ≤ n.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For exact polynomial reproduction, we need:
Σᵢp(pᵢ)h(x-pᵢ) = p(x) for all polynomials p of degree ≤ n

This requires the kernel to satisfy moment conditions:
∫x^α h(x)dx = δ_{α,0} for all multi-indices |α| ≤ n

In 1D, this means:
- ∫h(x)dx = 1 (partition of unity)
- ∫xʲh(x)dx = 0 for j = 1,2,...,n

The minimal support kernel satisfying these is the B-spline of degree n+1.

For the cubic B-spline (n=3):
h(x) = {
  (2-|x|)³/6,           1 ≤ |x| ≤ 2
  1 - 3|x|²/2 + 3|x|³/4, |x| < 1
  0,                     |x| > 2
}

This exactly reproduces polynomials up to degree 3. Higher-order kernels require wider support: support width = n+2 for degree n. ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.6 (Challenging)
Derive the optimal point distribution for approximating a given density function ρ(x) with N points to minimize rendering error.

**Hint**: Use Lloyd's algorithm perspective with Voronoi cells.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The L² approximation error for density ρ(x) with points {pᵢ} and weights {wᵢ}:
E = ∫|ρ(x) - Σᵢwᵢh(x-pᵢ)|²dx

For fixed kernel h, optimal weights satisfy:
∂E/∂wⱼ = 0 ⟹ Σᵢwᵢ∫h(x-pᵢ)h(x-pⱼ)dx = ∫ρ(x)h(x-pⱼ)dx

In matrix form: Gw = b where Gᵢⱼ = ∫h(x-pᵢ)h(x-pⱼ)dx

For optimal positions with fixed weights, ∂E/∂pⱼ = 0 gives:
pⱼ = ∫xρ(x)h(x-pⱼ)dx / ∫ρ(x)h(x-pⱼ)dx

This is a weighted centroid of ρ in the "influence region" of point j.

For Dirac kernels (h → δ), the optimal distribution has density:
n(x) ∝ ρ(x)^(d/(d+2))

In 3D: n(x) ∝ ρ(x)^(3/5)

This gives more samples where ρ is large but not linearly proportional. ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.7 (Implementation)
Derive the equations for EWA (Elliptical Weighted Average) splatting in screen space given 3D anisotropic Gaussians.

**Hint**: Project the 3D covariance matrix to 2D screen space.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Given 3D Gaussian with mean μ and covariance Σ₃:
g₃(x) = exp(-½(x-μ)ᵀΣ₃⁻¹(x-μ))

Under perspective projection P, a point x maps to screen space:
s = P(x) = [x/z, y/z]ᵀ

The Jacobian J = ∂s/∂x at x=μ:
J = (1/z)[I₂ | -s] where I₂ is 2×2 identity

The projected 2D covariance:
Σ₂ = JΣ₃Jᵀ

For view-aligned coordinates with Σ₃ = diag(σₓ², σᵧ², σᵤ²):
Σ₂ = (1/z²)[σₓ² + σᵤ²sₓ², σᵤ²sₓsᵧ; σᵤ²sₓsᵧ, σᵧ² + σᵤ²sᵧ²]

The 2D screen-space Gaussian:
g₂(s) = exp(-½(s-s₀)ᵀΣ₂⁻¹(s-s₀))

For rasterization, compute the ellipse containing 99% of the Gaussian:
(s-s₀)ᵀΣ₂⁻¹(s-s₀) < χ²₂(0.99) ≈ 9.21

This defines the bounding box and per-pixel weights. ✓
</details>

### Exercise 3.8 (Open-ended)
How would you extend the unified volume rendering equation to handle participating media with multiple scattering? What are the computational challenges?

**Hint**: Consider the rendering equation in participating media and path integral formulations.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The full radiative transfer equation with multiple scattering:
(ω·∇)L(x,ω) = -σₜ(x)L(x,ω) + σₛ(x)∫p(x,ω',ω)L(x,ω')dω' + σₐ(x)Lₑ(x,ω)

This is an integro-differential equation. The path integral solution:
L(x,ω) = Σₙ₌₀^∞ L⁽ⁿ⁾(x,ω)

where L⁽ⁿ⁾ is n-times scattered light:
L⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(x,ω) = ∫∫T(x,x')σₛ(x')p(x',ω',ω)L⁽ⁿ⁾(x',ω')dx'dω'

Computational challenges:
1. **Dimensionality**: 6D position-direction space
2. **Recursion**: Each scattering order requires full solution
3. **Anisotropic phase functions**: Complex angular dependencies
4. **Heterogeneous media**: Spatially varying properties

Practical approximations:
- Diffusion approximation for highly scattering media
- Spherical harmonics for angular dependence
- Monte Carlo path tracing with importance sampling
- Neural networks to learn scattering operators

The unified equation extends to:
L(o,ω) = ∫₀^∞ T(t)[Σₙ₌₀^∞ S⁽ⁿ⁾(r(t),ω)]dt

where S⁽ⁿ⁾ represents n-scattered in-scattered radiance. ✓
</details>

## Common Pitfalls and Errors (Gotchas)

1. **Kernel Normalization**: Failing to normalize kernels leads to energy loss/gain
   - Always ensure ∫h(x)dx = 1
   - For truncated Gaussians, renormalize over the support

2. **Aliasing in Screen Space**: 3D kernels can cause severe aliasing when projected
   - Use EWA splatting or pre-filter in 3D
   - Never ignore the z-component of anisotropic kernels

3. **Numerical Precision**: Exponentials in transmittance can underflow
   - Use log-space computations: log T(t) = -∫σ(s)ds
   - Switch to IEEE 754 double precision near zero

4. **Sorting Order**: Incorrect blending order breaks transmittance
   - Always sort splats front-to-back for correct occlusion
   - Back-to-front only valid for additive blending

5. **Boundary Handling**: Kernels near boundaries need special care
   - Renormalize to maintain partition of unity
   - Use ghost points or reflective boundaries

6. **Performance Cliffs**: Naive implementation scales poorly
   - Hierarchical culling essential for large point clouds
   - GPU divergence from variable splat sizes
