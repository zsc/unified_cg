# Chapter 1: Geometric Optics and Rendering Fundamentals

This chapter establishes the mathematical foundation for computer graphics through the lens of geometric optics. We develop the rendering equation as our central framework, introduce key radiometric concepts, and establish the path integral formulation that will unify all subsequent rendering techniques. By treating light transport as a high-dimensional integration problem, we set the stage for understanding point-based, image-based, and neural rendering methods as different approaches to solving the same fundamental equation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Derive the rendering equation from first principles using energy conservation
2. Transform between different coordinate systems while preserving radiometric quantities
3. Analyze BRDF properties and verify physical plausibility
4. Apply Monte Carlo methods to estimate high-dimensional integrals with known error bounds
5. Express light transport as a path integral and connect it to volume rendering

## 1.1 Ray Tracing Basics and the Rendering Equation

### Light as Rays in Geometric Optics

In geometric optics, we model light propagation using rays—infinitesimal beams that travel in straight lines through homogeneous media. A ray is parameterized as:

**r**(t) = **o** + t**d**

where **o** ∈ ℝ³ is the origin, **d** ∈ ℝ³ is the direction (||**d**|| = 1), and t ≥ 0 is the parameter along the ray.

### Radiometric Quantities

Before deriving the rendering equation, we must establish our radiometric framework:

**Radiant flux (power)** Φ measures energy per unit time:
Φ = dQ/dt [W]

**Irradiance** E measures flux per unit area:
E = dΦ/dA [W/m²]

**Radiance** L measures flux per unit area per unit solid angle:
L = d²Φ/(dA cos θ dω) [W/(m²·sr)]

Radiance is the fundamental quantity in rendering because it remains constant along rays in vacuum (radiance invariance).

### The Rendering Equation

The rendering equation, introduced by Kajiya (1986), describes the equilibrium distribution of light in a scene. At any surface point **x** with normal **n**, the outgoing radiance L_o in direction **ω**_o equals:

L_o(**x**, **ω**_o) = L_e(**x**, **ω**_o) + ∫_Ω f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) L_i(**x**, **ω**_i) (**ω**_i · **n**) dω_i

where:
- L_e is emitted radiance
- f_r is the BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function)
- L_i is incident radiance
- Ω is the hemisphere above **x**
- (**ω**_i · **n**) = cos θ_i accounts for projected area

### Energy Conservation and the Measurement Equation

The rendering equation conserves energy when:

∫_Ω f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) cos θ_i dω_i ≤ 1 for all **ω**_o

This constraint ensures physically plausible BRDFs. The measurement equation connects scene radiance to sensor response:

I_j = ∫_A ∫_Ω W_j(**x**, **ω**) L(**x**, **ω**) cos θ dω dA

where W_j is the importance (sensitivity) function for pixel j.

### Operator Form and Neumann Series

We can write the rendering equation in operator form:

L = L_e + 𝒯L

where 𝒯 is the transport operator:

(𝒯L)(**x**, **ω**) = ∫_Ω f_r(**x**, **ω**', **ω**) L(**x**, **ω**') (**ω**' · **n**) dω'

The solution is given by the Neumann series:

L = ∑_{k=0}^∞ 𝒯^k L_e = L_e + 𝒯L_e + 𝒯²L_e + ...

Each term represents light that has bounced k times, providing the foundation for path tracing algorithms.

## 1.2 Coordinate Systems and Transformations

### World, Camera, and Object Spaces

Rendering involves multiple coordinate systems:

1. **World space**: Global scene coordinates
2. **Object space**: Local to each geometric primitive
3. **Camera space**: Origin at eye, z-axis along view direction
4. **Screen space**: 2D projection plane coordinates

Transformations between spaces use 4×4 homogeneous matrices:

**p**' = **M****p**

where **p** = [x, y, z, 1]^T for points and **p** = [x, y, z, 0]^T for vectors.

### Normal Transformations

Normals transform differently than points to preserve orthogonality. If **M** transforms points, then normals transform by:

**n**' = (**M**^{-T})^{3×3} **n**

This uses the upper-left 3×3 submatrix of the inverse transpose.

### Spherical Coordinates

Many rendering calculations benefit from spherical coordinates:

**ω** = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ)

where θ ∈ [0, π] is polar angle and φ ∈ [0, 2π] is azimuthal angle. The differential solid angle is:

dω = sin θ dθ dφ

### Change of Variables in Integrals

When changing integration variables, we must include the Jacobian determinant. For example, converting from solid angle to area:

∫_Ω f(**ω**) dω = ∫_A f(**ω**(**x**')) |∂**ω**/∂**x**'| dA'

For visibility between points **x** and **x**':

dω = cos θ'/||**x** - **x**'||² dA'

This relationship is crucial for area light sampling.

### Barycentric Coordinates

For triangles with vertices **v**₀, **v**₁, **v**₂, any point **p** can be expressed as:

**p** = u**v**₀ + v**v**₁ + w**v**₂

where u + v + w = 1. These coordinates enable efficient interpolation and intersection tests.

## 1.3 BRDF, BSDF, and BSSRDF

### Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)

The BRDF f_r quantifies how light reflects off a surface:

f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) = dL_o(**x**, **ω**_o) / (L_i(**x**, **ω**_i) cos θ_i dω_i) [sr⁻¹]

It represents the ratio of reflected radiance to incident irradiance.

### Fundamental BRDF Properties

**Reciprocity (Helmholtz reciprocity):**
f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) = f_r(**x**, **ω**_o, **ω**_i)

This follows from the reversibility of light paths and is essential for bidirectional algorithms.

**Energy conservation:**
∫_Ω f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) cos θ_o dω_o ≤ 1 for all **ω**_i

The albedo ρ(**ω**_i) equals this integral and represents total reflectance.

**Non-negativity:**
f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) ≥ 0

### Extension to BSDF

The Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF) generalizes BRDF to include transmission:

f_s(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) = f_r(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) + f_t(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o)

For transmission through interfaces with refractive indices n_i and n_o, reciprocity becomes:

n_i² f_t(**x**, **ω**_i, **ω**_o) = n_o² f_t(**x**, **ω**_o, **ω**_i)

### BSSRDF for Subsurface Scattering

The Bidirectional Scattering Surface Reflectance Distribution Function accounts for light entering at **x**_i and exiting at **x**_o:

S(**x**_i, **ω**_i, **x**_o, **ω**_o) = dL_o(**x**_o, **ω**_o) / (dΦ_i(**x**_i, **ω**_i))  [m⁻²sr⁻¹]

The rendering equation with BSSRDF becomes:

L_o(**x**_o, **ω**_o) = ∫_A ∫_Ω S(**x**_i, **ω**_i, **x**_o, **ω**_o) L_i(**x**_i, **ω**_i) cos θ_i dω_i dA_i

### Mathematical Constraints and Physical Plausibility

A physically plausible BRDF must satisfy:

1. **Reciprocity**: f_r(**ω**_i, **ω**_o) = f_r(**ω**_o, **ω**_i)
2. **Energy conservation**: ρ(**ω**) ≤ 1 for all **ω**
3. **Positivity**: f_r ≥ 0
4. **Measurability**: f_r ∈ L¹(Ω × Ω)

For anisotropic materials, the BRDF depends on the surface orientation relative to a tangent frame.

## 1.4 Monte Carlo Integration in Rendering

### Expected Value and Variance

Monte Carlo integration estimates integrals using random sampling:

I = ∫_Ω f(**x**) d**x** ≈ (1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N f(**X**_i)/p(**X**_i)

where **X**_i ~ p(**x**) are samples from probability density p.

The estimator is unbiased: E[Î] = I

The variance is:
Var[Î] = (1/N) ∫_Ω (f(**x**)/p(**x**) - I)² p(**x**) d**x**

### Importance Sampling

Optimal sampling minimizes variance by matching p to |f|:

p*(**x**) = |f(**x**)| / ∫_Ω |f(**x**)| d**x**

For the rendering equation, good sampling strategies include:
- BRDF sampling: p(**ω**) ∝ f_r(**ω**_i, **ω**_o)
- Light sampling: p(**ω**) ∝ L_e
- Cosine sampling: p(**ω**) ∝ cos θ

### Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS)

When multiple sampling strategies are available, MIS combines them optimally:

Î = ∑_{i=1}^{n_f} w_f(**X**_{f,i}) f(**X**_{f,i})/p_f(**X**_{f,i}) + ∑_{j=1}^{n_g} w_g(**X**_{g,j}) f(**X**_{g,j})/p_g(**X**_{g,j})

The balance heuristic provides good weights:
w_f(**x**) = n_f p_f(**x**) / (n_f p_f(**x**) + n_g p_g(**x**))

### Russian Roulette

To create unbiased estimators with finite computation, Russian roulette randomly terminates paths:

L'_i = {
  L_i/q  with probability q
  0      with probability 1-q
}

This maintains E[L'_i] = L_i while bounding computation.

### Convergence Rates and Error Bounds

Monte Carlo convergence follows the Central Limit Theorem:

P(|Î - I| ≤ ε) ≈ 2Φ(ε√N/σ) - 1

where Φ is the normal CDF and σ² is the variance. The error decreases as O(1/√N), independent of dimension—crucial for high-dimensional light transport.

## 1.5 Path Integral Formulation

### Light Transport as Path Integration

We can reformulate the rendering equation as an integral over all possible light paths. A path of length k is:

**x̄** = **x**₀**x**₁...**x**_k

where **x**₀ is on a light source and **x**_k is on the camera sensor.

### Path Space and Measure

The path space Ω̄_k consists of all valid paths of length k. The measure for a path is:

dμ(**x̄**) = dA(**x**₀) ∏_{i=1}^{k} dA(**x**_i)

The contribution of a path is:

f(**x̄**) = L_e(**x**₀ → **x**₁) (∏_{i=1}^{k-1} f_s(**x**_{i-1} → **x**_i → **x**_{i+1}) G(**x**_i ↔ **x**_{i+1})) W(**x**_{k-1} → **x**_k)

where G is the geometry factor:

G(**x** ↔ **x**') = V(**x** ↔ **x**') cos θ cos θ' / ||**x** - **x**'||²

### Connection to Feynman Path Integrals

The path integral formulation resembles Feynman's approach to quantum mechanics:

I = ∑_{k=2}^∞ ∫_{Ω̄_k} f(**x̄**) dμ(**x̄**)

This infinite sum over all path lengths captures global illumination. Each term represents paths with k-1 bounces.

### Recursive Formulation and Neumann Series

The value at a point satisfies the recursive relation:

L(**x**, **ω**) = L_e(**x**, **ω**) + ∫_M f_s(**y** → **x** → **ω**) L(**y**, **x** - **y**) G(**y** ↔ **x**) dA(**y**)

This leads to the Neumann series solution:

L = L^{(0)} + L^{(1)} + L^{(2)} + ...

where L^{(k)} represents k-bounce illumination.

### Volume Rendering Equation Preview

The path integral naturally extends to participating media. For a volume with absorption σ_a, scattering σ_s, and phase function p:

L(**x**, **ω**) = ∫₀^∞ T(0,t) [σ_a L_e + σ_s ∫_{S²} p(**ω**', **ω**) L(**x**+t**ω**, **ω**') dω'] dt + T(0,∞) L_∞

where T(s,t) = exp(-∫_s^t σ_t(**x**+u**ω**) du) is transmittance.

This unified formulation will connect all rendering methods in subsequent chapters.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter established the mathematical foundation for computer graphics through geometric optics:

1. **The rendering equation** L_o = L_e + ∫ f_r L_i cos θ dω governs light transport
2. **Coordinate transformations** preserve radiometric quantities when properly applied
3. **BRDFs** must satisfy reciprocity, energy conservation, and non-negativity
4. **Monte Carlo methods** solve high-dimensional integrals with O(1/√N) convergence
5. **Path integrals** unify light transport as integration over all possible paths

These concepts form the basis for all rendering algorithms. The path integral formulation particularly enables our unified treatment of point-based, image-based, and neural rendering methods as different approaches to the same fundamental equation.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: Radiance Along a Ray
Prove that radiance remains constant along a ray in vacuum. Start from the definition of radiance and use the inverse square law.

**Hint:** Consider two differential areas dA₁ and dA₂ along the ray and show that L₁ = L₂.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Consider differential areas dA₁ and dA₂ at distances r₁ and r₂ along a ray. The solid angles subtended are:

dω₁ = dA₂ cos θ₂ / r₁₂²
dω₂ = dA₁ cos θ₁ / r₁₂²

The flux leaving dA₁ toward dA₂ is:
dΦ = L₁ dA₁ cos θ₁ dω₁ = L₁ dA₁ cos θ₁ dA₂ cos θ₂ / r₁₂²

By energy conservation, this equals the flux arriving at dA₂:
dΦ = L₂ dA₂ cos θ₂ dω₂ = L₂ dA₂ cos θ₂ dA₁ cos θ₁ / r₁₂²

Therefore L₁ = L₂, proving radiance invariance.
</details>

### Exercise 1.2: BRDF Energy Conservation
Prove that a Lambertian BRDF f_r = ρ/π satisfies energy conservation for any albedo ρ ≤ 1.

**Hint:** Integrate over the hemisphere using spherical coordinates.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For Lambertian BRDF f_r = ρ/π, the directional-hemispherical reflectance is:

∫_Ω f_r cos θ_o dω_o = (ρ/π) ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{π/2} cos θ sin θ dθ dφ

= (ρ/π) · 2π · ∫₀^{π/2} cos θ sin θ dθ

= (ρ/π) · 2π · [sin² θ/2]₀^{π/2}

= (ρ/π) · 2π · (1/2) = ρ

Since ρ ≤ 1, energy conservation is satisfied.
</details>

### Exercise 1.3: Monte Carlo Variance
Derive the optimal importance sampling distribution for estimating ∫₀¹ √x dx and calculate the resulting variance.

**Hint:** The optimal PDF is proportional to |f(x)|.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For f(x) = √x on [0,1], the optimal PDF is:

p*(x) = √x / ∫₀¹ √x dx = √x / (2/3) = (3/2)√x

To sample: X = F⁻¹(U) where F(x) = ∫₀ˣ (3/2)√t dt = x^{3/2}

Therefore X = U^{2/3}

With this sampling, the estimator becomes:
f(X)/p*(X) = √X / ((3/2)√X) = 2/3

Since the estimator is constant, the variance is 0—perfect importance sampling eliminates variance.
</details>

### Exercise 1.4: Path Integral Convergence (Challenge)
Show that the Neumann series for the rendering equation converges when the maximum albedo in the scene is less than 1.

**Hint:** Use the operator norm ||𝒯|| ≤ ρ_max < 1.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The transport operator 𝒯 satisfies:

||(𝒯L)||_∞ ≤ ρ_max ||L||_∞

where ρ_max = max_{x,ω} ∫_Ω f_r(x,ω',ω) cos θ' dω' < 1

By induction: ||𝒯^k L_e||_∞ ≤ ρ_max^k ||L_e||_∞

The Neumann series converges:
||∑_{k=0}^∞ 𝒯^k L_e||_∞ ≤ ∑_{k=0}^∞ ρ_max^k ||L_e||_∞ = ||L_e||_∞/(1-ρ_max)

This proves convergence for ρ_max < 1.
</details>

### Exercise 1.5: Coordinate Transform Jacobian
Derive the Jacobian for converting the rendering equation from integration over solid angle to integration over surface area.

**Hint:** Start with dω = dA cos θ'/r².

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Given points x and x' with connecting vector r = x' - x:

dω = dA' cos θ' / ||r||²

The rendering equation becomes:

L_o(x,ω_o) = L_e(x,ω_o) + ∫_M f_r(x,ω(x'),ω_o) L_i(x',−ω(x')) V(x↔x') (cos θ cos θ')/||r||² dA'

where:
- ω(x') = (x' - x)/||x' - x|| 
- cos θ = n(x) · ω(x')
- cos θ' = -n(x') · ω(x')
- V(x↔x') is the visibility function

The Jacobian is |∂ω/∂x'| = cos θ'/||r||².
</details>

### Exercise 1.6: BSDF Reciprocity with Refraction (Challenge)
Derive the generalized reciprocity relation for BSDF with refraction between media with refractive indices n₁ and n₂.

**Hint:** Use radiance in phase space L̃ = L/n².

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Define phase space radiance L̃ = L/n². In a medium with index n:

L̃ is invariant along rays (generalized radiance theorem)

At an interface, power conservation requires:

L̃₁(x,ω_i) dω_i = L̃₂(x,ω_t) dω_t

Using Snell's law: n₁ sin θ_i = n₂ sin θ_t

The solid angle ratio is: dω_t/dω_i = (n₁/n₂)² cos θ_t/cos θ_i

For the BTDF: f_t(ω_i→ω_t) = dL₂/dE₁ = (n₂²/n₁²) dL̃₂/dẼ₁

By time-reversal symmetry of Maxwell's equations:

n₁² f_t(x,ω_i→ω_t) = n₂² f_t(x,ω_t→ω_i)
</details>

### Exercise 1.7: Russian Roulette Bias
Prove that Russian roulette with continuation probability q creates an unbiased estimator.

**Hint:** Use the law of total expectation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Let L be the true value and L' be the Russian roulette estimator:

L' = {
  L/q  with probability q
  0    with probability 1-q
}

The expected value is:

E[L'] = q · (L/q) + (1-q) · 0 = L

Therefore E[L'] = L, proving the estimator is unbiased.

The variance is:
Var[L'] = E[L'²] - (E[L'])² = q(L/q)² - L² = L²/q - L² = L²(1-q)/q

Note that variance increases as q decreases, showing the bias-variance tradeoff.
</details>

### Exercise 1.8: Volume Rendering Convergence (Open Problem)
Consider the volume rendering equation with spatially varying extinction. Under what conditions does the path integral formulation converge? Discuss the relationship between optical thickness and convergence rate.

**Hint:** Consider the maximum optical thickness τ_max along any ray.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For volumes with bounded extinction σ_t ≤ σ_max and albedo α = σ_s/σ_t ≤ α_max < 1:

The k-th scattering term is bounded by:
||L^{(k)}||_∞ ≤ ||L_e||_∞ α_max^k

This ensures geometric convergence.

For optical thickness τ = ∫ σ_t ds along a ray:
- Low τ: Single scattering dominates, fast convergence
- High τ: Multiple scattering important, slower convergence
- τ → ∞: Diffusion regime, may need specialized methods

Open questions:
1. Optimal importance sampling for heterogeneous media
2. Convergence rate vs. spatial frequency of σ_t
3. Connection to transport mean free path in multiple scattering
</details>

## Common Pitfalls and Errors (Gotchas)

1. **Radiance vs. Irradiance Confusion**
   - Radiance has units W/(m²·sr), irradiance has W/m²
   - Always check dimensional consistency in equations
   - Remember: cameras measure irradiance (integrated radiance)

2. **Incorrect Normal Transformation**
   - Normals transform by inverse transpose, not the direct matrix
   - Failing to renormalize after transformation
   - Sign errors when transforming between coordinate systems

3. **BRDF Energy Conservation Violations**
   - Forgetting the cosine term in the integral
   - Not accounting for Fresnel effects at grazing angles
   - Incorrect normalization of analytical BRDF models

4. **Monte Carlo Bias from PDF Errors**
   - PDF must be > 0 wherever integrand is non-zero
   - Normalization errors in importance sampling
   - Forgetting Jacobian when changing variables

5. **Numerical Precision Issues**
   - Ray-sphere intersection can fail due to catastrophic cancellation
   - Small denominators in geometry factor G(x↔x')
   - Accumulated error in long ray paths
